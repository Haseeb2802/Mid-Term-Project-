              <p class="card-text">The Roman Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is perhaps the most famous ancient landmark in the world. The Colosseum was the host to thousands     of gladiatorial shows, mock naval battles, executions, and animal hunts. Today, the Colosseum still stands in the center of Rome, Italy, however, not quite as it used to be. Still, today, the Roman Colosseum is a large tourist attraction, thousands of tourists from all over the world still come to view this marveled arena. The Roman Colosseum has a rich history, and remains a prized possession of the Roman citizens.



                Construction of the Colosseum was initiated by Roman emperor Vespasian, around 70 AD. Vespasian named the Colosseum after the colossus of Nero, a large statue that stood nearby.

              <p class="card-text">
                Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people even associate India with Taj Mahal. However, to me, more than the splendid architecture, it is the story behind it that appeals to me the most. This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of the love of a husband to his wife. Moreover, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for generations to come.

                Taj Maha - A Symbol of Love
                The renowned Taj Mahal was brought to life by the vision of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. He got this monument built for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal after she passed away.
                
                To honor the memory of his loving wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from all over the world to build it.

              <p class="card-text">The Stonehenge has a mystery that people have been longing to solve for hundreds of years. The specific questions asked about this landmark is where it's located, how was this structure built, what did these ancient cultures use this for. Well when it comes to answering these questions it is difficult. There are many different speculations with no sufficient evidence. Stonehenge lies in the north country of Wiltshire in central southern England, about 30 miles north of the English Channel coast.

                The Stonehenge's construction was a mystery itself. With no exact or similar precedent and no future plans of anything like this, it makes it hard to understand it's existence. The monument as a whole was constructed over fourteen or fifteen hundred years, equivalent to seventy generations.

At the time, Lady Liberty was letting them know that their journey to find freedom, democracy, and a better way of life, was officially over. The Statue of Liberty is very important to many Americans because of what it represents. (Statue of Liberty National Monument)(Immigration) In 1865, Edvouvard de Laboulaye, of France, thought of the idea to build the Statue of Liberty while he was on a visit to New York. He commissioned Frederick-Auguste Bartholdi to design the statue. Barthholdi needed someone with experience with building the outer skeletons of statues, so he asked for the assistance of Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. While designing…show more content…

              <p class="card-text">The history of Egypt is one of the richest and the most amazing examples of how people could be devoted to their roots and traditions and what methods they could use to protect and improve their own culture.

                Egyptian Art was influenced by a variety of things: religion, politics, relations with different countries, environment, and citizens’ treatment (Sporre 205). Due to such close connection, Egyptian Art became recognizable by different countries within a short period of time, and Egyptian pyramids are considered to be one of the first and the most marvelous world wonders.
                
                Three magnificent pyramids of the desert at Giza have a long history that began over 4,000 years ago and represent a true marvel of architectural art: Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure were the kings under which orders the pyramids were build and the kings those actions, ideas, and principles will be saved and protected by the power of the pyramids.

It is presently the fifth largest mosque in the world and was indisputably the largest mosque in the world from 1673 to 1986 when the Faisal Mosque was constructed in Islamabad. Although it was built late in the Mughal era in a period of relative decline, its beauty, elegance, and scale epitomize Mughal cultural achievement like no other monument in Lahore.

                Construction of the mosque began in 1671 under the direction of Muzaffar Hussain (Fida'i Khan Koka), Aurangzeb's brother-in-law and the governor of Lahore. It was originally planned as a reliquary to safeguard a strand of the Prophet's hair. Its grand scale is influenced by the Jama Mosque of Delhi which had been built by Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan. 
                The plan of Badshahi mosque is essentially a square measuring 170 meters on each side </div>

              <p class="card-text">In the old days Paris was known to be the capital of culture where many of the famous authors went for their higher education. In addition to that, the French people had great interests in building and architecture. Here are two of the best monuments that we can talk about today, Eiffel tower and Arch of Triumph.



                Eiffel Tower,  they started building it in 1887 and finished it in 1889 , its located in Paris on the Champ de Mars to be the entrance arch to the  World's Fair in 1889 , it was built and designed by the company of the engineer Gustave Eiffel.The tower looked like a huge arch of steel or iron, with 324 meters tall or ‘1,063 ft’. The medium that used to build this huge tower is iron lattice and some concrete on the bottom (the two bottom legs of the Eiffel tower).
                
                
                
                There are no connections between this tower and earlier art history because when building the Eiffel tower they used new ways and techniques which were not familiar on that time.
