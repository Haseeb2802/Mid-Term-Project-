              <p class="card-text">Istanbul is both an ancient and modern city that is full of culture dating back to the beginning of time. It's a city that is unique, in that, it connects both Europe and Asia. Istanbul is the largest city in Turkey and the most crowded one too. There are approximately more than fourteen million people living in Istanbul alone.  That is more than its capital city of Ankara. Istanbul is not just a metropolitan, or one of the most crowded cities, and it’s also an ancient and historical city.

                The city of Istanbul was originally known as Constantinople back in the time of the Byzantine Empire Days.  Then, in 1453, Constantinople became part of Ottoman Empire and over the years, the name of the city was changed to Istanbul. Since both empires occupied Istanbul at one point, its leaders brought over many rich and diverse cultures, ideas, and many architectural designs.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, is one of the most beautiful, green cities you will find in the country. Surrounded on one side by the lush green Margalla Hills, it gives a perfect blend of sightseeing and an urban lifestyle.

                Being the capital, it is the most developed city in the country, and the most organized one. Areas are easy to access as the roads are well developed and mostly straight and at right angles to each other.
                
                The city is divided into square areas of 4 km2 each, called sectors. The sectors are arranged and numbered such that it is really easy to identify which direction a particular sector lies in. Each sector has a market or a shopping area in the middle, called the Markaz.The usual way to commute is via taxi or cabs. Though one can rent a car from the various rent-a-cars operating here, or commute via the radio cabs which are just a phone call away.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Japan (Tokyo) My dream is going to Japan to see the beautiful city Tokyo. Tokyo is the capital of Japan and it has a population of 13 million people. Tokyo is a marvelous mix of modern living and old-fashioned manners, slick high-tech gadgets and cutesy cartoon mascots. It's terribly crowded, yet can be strangely quiet. It's home to the understated, and the wacky, and you often find them right next to each other on the sidewalk. Tokyo was originally a small fishing village named Edo, now it is modern city and hosts 51 of the Fortune Global 500 companies, the highest number of any city.
                I have a plan to go with my family there next year Feb. 2015. Tokyo will be the first destination we will visit in Asia. We will stay there for almost 10 days. We will travel to Tokyo by Japan Airlines and it will cost us $5,270. Also, I will rent a car for almost 10 days and it will cost us $840.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Los Angeles is one of the most exciting cities in the United States. According to the Los Angeles post record tourist numbers in 2012, the city attracts 41.4 million visitors per year. Even though the traffic is terrible, Los Angeles is still one of my favorite places because of the many restaurants to dine in, and the many wonderful attractions. 

                Traffic in Los Angeles is implausible. The streets are congested from morning to night and everyone seems to be in a hurry from the walkers to the drivers. My first time in Los Angeles the traffic was so bad that crossing the street literally scared me; I stood there for the longest time, looking at the light, trying to figure out when to cross.…show more content…
                My first time there, I was astonished at all the things Los Angeles had going on. I really enjoyed Universal Studios, Holly Wood walk of fame, Disney Land and the Los Angeles Museum. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Singapore is an island country in Southeast Asia, just off the Malay Peninsula and 85 miles north of the equator. The country is young but well developed with leaning skyscrapers, diverse communities and unique buildings. Singapore has many cultures living within it, as a result there is a very diverse way of life with people speaking many languages and worshiping a number of different religions. Such a wide range of cultures makes the country very accepting of others.

                In 1963 Singapore gained independence from the United Kingdom. Many of the people who lived in Singapore went there from India, Malaysia and China in seek of labouring work to earn money. After independence was granted the process of finding a single Singaporean identity began. The diverse culture can be noticed when you walk the streets to see mosques, synagogues and churches.</p>
